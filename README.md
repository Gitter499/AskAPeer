## A Q&A platform for college students

**Entrant to 10PiHacks Hackathon**

Built by Rafayel Amirkhanyan

### Idea

A Q&A platform where college students can ask questions regarding college, and get anonymous answers by other college students. Each question has certain tags and students can specify the college. Students who answer and get tagged with a helpful answer receive metapoints and badges

### Implementation

Given the hackathon nature, I decided to use technologies I am comfortable with. 

I am using Node+Express for the backend of the app, with a low-level but easy to use Database.

For frontend, I am using a simple React project with Formik, CSS, and support libraries
